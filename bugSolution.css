The issue can be solved in a couple of ways:

**Solution 1: Specificity and Cascade**

Adjust the order of classes in the selector.  Sometimes, the order of selectors can affect cascade. Alternatively, increase specificity if needed. For example, changing the `:hover` selector might fix it:

```css
.another-class.my-class:hover {
  color: green;
}
```

**Solution 2: Separate Hover Style**

Instead of chaining classes in the selector, explicitly create a separate style for the hover state:

```css
.my-class.another-class {
  color: red;
}

.my-class.another-class:hover {
  color: green;
}
```

**Solution 3 (If solution 1 and 2 doesn't work):  Check for conflicting styles**
Ensure there are no other CSS rules with higher specificity that are overriding the `:hover` style.  Check for styles in external CSS files or inline styles that might be conflicting.
