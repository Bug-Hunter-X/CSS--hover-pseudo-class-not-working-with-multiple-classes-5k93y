# CSS :hover Pseudo-class Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue with the CSS `:hover` pseudo-class when applied to an element with multiple classes.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides a solution.

The problem is that the `:hover` style is not applied despite seemingly correct syntax. This is likely due to an unusual cascade order or unexpected behavior in the browser's rendering engine (specific to the combination of classes).  The solution involves adjusting the selector or applying a more robust styling approach.  See the `bugSolution.css` file for details.
