The following CSS code has an unusual error.  It uses a seemingly valid selector, but it fails to style the target element. 

```css
.my-class {
  color: blue;
}

.my-class.another-class {
  color: red;
}

/* This is the problematic part */
.my-class.another-class:hover {
  color: green; /* This style is never applied */
}
```

The `.my-class.another-class` selector works correctly for setting the color to red. However, the `:hover` pseudo-class added to the same selector does not change the color to green.  It's as if the hover state is not recognized for that particular combination of classes.
